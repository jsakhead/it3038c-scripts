The goal of this script is to take the user's input of a US time zone 
Once a valid US time zone is entered the current date and time of that time zone will be displayed in the console
This is a python script so it should be run in whatever Python console you choose to use whether by saving the file and running it in a python console or copying the code and pasting it into an IDE and running it from there.  
The main improvements I made to this script for this project are that it is now included in a while loop.
Another improvement I made is that once an input is made whether valid or not instead of just exiting out of the script it prompts the user asking if they would like to run it again or not. If the user selects yes then it will start over and if they select no it will display a goodbye message and kill the script.
