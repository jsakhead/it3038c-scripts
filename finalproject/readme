The goal of this script is to take the user's input of a US time zone Once a valid US time zone is entered the current date and time of that time zone will be displayed in the console This is a python script so it should be run in whatever Python console you choose to use whether by saving the file and running it in a python console or copying the code and pasting it into an IDE and running it from there.
This is a project I have built open for the 3 main projects we have done throughout the semester and has been very useful in helping me understand Python since I have not had a lot of experience with Python. 
Throughout the project I have changed how the loops work and eventually worked to make the main loop of the project a function so that it can have more versatility in how it is used.
Originally the time of the timezones was being displayed in a ugly 24 hour military time format that just is not user friendly so I worked to convert the time output to show in the general 12 hour format users are used to seeing when reading time.
